\chapter{Verification \& Validation}

\section{Verification}

Verification refers to demonstrating that the product performance matches the design. In other words is the product "doing it right"?

\section{Validation}

Validation on the other hand confirms that the product meets the stated user need. "Doing the right thing" is another way to put this succinctly.
